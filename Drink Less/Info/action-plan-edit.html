          <p>The key thing here is to create both an If and a Then. Here  are some examples of what you might write. They might work as is, but are  probably better if you personalise them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IF I'm out for a drink. THEN I'll drink a glass of water for  every glass of alcohol.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I feel like I want a reward. THEN I'll choose something  else I love doing.</li>
              <li>IF My thought turns to alcohol at five o'clock . THEN I'll  remind myself why I want to drink less.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I'm going to pick up a bottle on my way home. THEN I'll  remind myself of all the reasons for sticking to my goal.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I'm tempted to drink more than I want to. THEN I'll do  something on this app first.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I'm feeling a strong urge to drink. THEN I'll remember  it's a craving and all cravings pass. <br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I'm bored at home and want to drink. THEN I'll complete something  on to do list instead.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I have too many social occasions in the diary. Then I'll  plan in advance how many I'll drink at each one.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF my friends want to go to the pub. THEN I'll suggest doing  something else instead.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I am feeling low or anxious. THEN I will try to distract  myself with something I love doing.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I am out in the pub with friends. THEN I will order small  glasses of wine, not large.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I'm feeling stressed and want to relax quickly. THEN I'll  choose exercise instead.<br>
              </li>
              <li>IF I want to go to the pub. THEN I'll take my car.</li>
