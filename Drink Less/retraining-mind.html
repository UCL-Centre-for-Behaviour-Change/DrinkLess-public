            <p>Research has shown that we sometimes drink but don’t know why this is. This is like an unconscious impulse to say “yes” to the idea of drinking. One way to help you stick to a decision to drink less is to reduce the power of that impulse and a number of studies have shown this to work.</p>
            <p>Because some of the pictures involve alcohol, some studies have found that it could retrain your mind unconsciously to reject alcohol - at least a little bit!</p>
            <p>This game has been designed to help you do just that, and be a bit of fun too.</p>
