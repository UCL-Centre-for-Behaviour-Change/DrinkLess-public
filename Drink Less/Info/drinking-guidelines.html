        <h1>Drinking Guidelines</h1>
        <p>The government&rsquo;s drinking guidelines have three key recommendations. </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Limit your weekly drinking to 14 units<br>
          </strong>Whether you are a man or a woman try not to regularly drink more than 14  units of alcohol per week. If you drink as much as 14 units per week, it&rsquo;s best  to spread this evenly over 3-5 days but keep 2-4 days alcohol free. See Help  &gt; Units guide.        </li>
          <li><strong>Avoid drinking more than 6 units </strong><strong>on any one occasion<br>
          </strong>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to less than 6 units on any one  occasion, if  necessary by drinking more slowly, drinking with food or alternating with a  soft drink</li>
          <li><strong>Do not drink at all if you are pregnant<br>
          </strong>Any amount of alcohol can harm your baby, so it is best not to drink at  all.        </li>
        </ol>
