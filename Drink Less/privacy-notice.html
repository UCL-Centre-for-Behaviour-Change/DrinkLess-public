            <p>The data we collect is anonymous and will only be used for academic research conducted by University College London with a view to developing improved ways of helping people to drink less.</p>

            <p>The Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group at University College London (UCL) is collecting the data and processes users’ data for the following purposes:
              <ul>
                <li>To help users drink less</li>
                <li>To improve the smartphone application</li>
                <li>To conduct research and write publications that add to the scientific literature</li>
                <li>To communicate with users</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The data collected includes that which the user voluntarily enters or provides when using the Drink Less app (e.g. gender, age, country, job type, alcohol consumption) and app usage. App versions up to and including 1.0.10 collected personal data – email addresses – which was entered voluntarily.<br/>
              Those personal data will be stored for three years.
            </p>

            <p>

              Processing of users’ data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. Health data on alcohol consumption is necessary for scientific research purposes and is in accordance with safeguards.

            </p>

            <p>
              Research governance within UCL ensures that data is:
              <ul>
                <li>Necessary to support research</li>
                <li>Only used to support legitimate research activities that are considered to be in the public interest</li>
                <li>Safeguarded/protected</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>Disclosure:</i><br/>
              The Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group at UCL will not share user data with any third parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>Right of access:</i><br/>
              As the data collected is anonymous, it is not possible to link any data we hold with an individual user.
              For versions up to and including 1.0.10 of the app, email addresses were collected from some users. If a user downloaded one of these app versions and entered their email address, then the Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group at UCL can share the data held on the user. Up to three years after downloading the app, users can request this by emailing <a href="mailto:support@drinklessalcohol.com">support@drinklessalcohol.com</a> along with the email address entered during the registration process. The Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group at UCL will then send users the data that it holds on them within one calendar month of receipt.
