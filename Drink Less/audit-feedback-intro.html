            <p>Prepare yourself! We&rsquo;re going to show you how your drinking compares with other people and this might come as a bit of a surprise. If so, don&rsquo;t worry, there are plenty of things you can do about it if you want to, and this app is here to help.</p>
            <p>These data come from a large survey of adults in England called the <a href="http://www.alcoholinengland.info">Alcohol Toolkit Study</a>.
            <p>The survey asks adults over 16 years old about their drinking - this includes people who don&rsquo;t drink at all who you may have forgotten about when answering the questions on the previous screen. Remember, we usually socialize with people who drink similar amounts and so assume everyone drinks that much.</p>
