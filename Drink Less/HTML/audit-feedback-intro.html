            <p>We&rsquo;re going to show you how your drinking compares with other people and this might come as a bit of a surprise. If so, don&rsquo;t worry, there are plenty of things you can do if you want to drink less, and this app is here to help.</p>
            <p>These data come from a large survey called the <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" href="http://www.alcoholinengland.info">Alcohol Toolkit Study</a> that has asked over 90,000 adults in England about their drinking. This includes people who only drink occasionally or not at all, who are easy to forget about as we usually socialise with people who drink similar amounts.</p>
