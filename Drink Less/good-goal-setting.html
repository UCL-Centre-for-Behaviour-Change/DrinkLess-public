          <h1>How to set good goals</h1>

            <p>Good goals are specific and a little challenging. Not too challenging though, because the  hardest thing about making a change is often sticking with it. So it's  important to keep your goals realistic. You can alter them at any time if you  find they're too difficult or too easy%@.</p>
            <p>You can set goals for:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Number  of alcohol free days a week</li>
              <li>The  total amount of alcohol you drink</li>
              <li>The  number of calories you get from alcohol</li>
              <li>The  money you spend on alcohol.</li>
          </ol>
            <p>We suggest you start with a couple and take it from there.</p>
