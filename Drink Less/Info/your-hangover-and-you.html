            <p>These graphs show how your mood, productivity, clarity and sleep are affected by heavy drinking; scores are taken from the answers you gave to the questions in the mood diary.</p>
            <p>All the scores on mornings after you've drunk more than %@ units go in the 'Day's after drinking' column. All the scores on mornings after you've drunk less or nothing at all are in the 'Days after not drinking' column.</p>
           <p>Compare the height of the two columns to see if - and by how much - alcohol affects you the next day.</p>
