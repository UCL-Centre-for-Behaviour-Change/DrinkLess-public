            <h1>Action Plans</h1>

            <p>Achieving a goal   is easier when you&rsquo;ve got a plan.  Planning helps you manage situations when you may be tempted to drink a bit too much. To make the plans work best, be   specific  and say <strong>IF </strong>a certain thing happens <strong>THEN</strong> you&rsquo;ll do something else. </p>
            <p>Here's some  examples. Feel free to copy them, amend them or use them as inspiration for your own:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>IF</strong> I&rsquo;ve had two drinks and I&rsquo;m offered  another, <strong>THEN</strong> I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Thank  you, I&rsquo;ll  have a juice&quot;</li>
              <li><strong>IF</strong> I reach for the bottle of wine at dinner, <strong>THEN</strong> I'll choose water instead</li>
              <li><strong>IF</strong> I'm about to walk into the pub, <strong>THEN</strong> I'll remind myself of my drinking goals</li>
              <li><strong>IF </strong>I feel a bit tipsy, <strong>THEN</strong> I'll decide to not drink any more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Follow the IF/THEN structure and be as specific as you can when creating these plans. If  they&rsquo;re specific they come to mind more easily, right when you  need them.          </p>
          <p><strong>Why  they work</strong><br>
              Here comes the science bit. IF/THEN  plans (called implementation intentions) seem to work because having a concrete  plan for specific situations means the plan can be performed  automatically and without conscious effort. As a result you don&rsquo;t have to rely  on willpower, something alcohol is known to weaken.</p>
          <p>You might be thinking that implementation  intentions are too simple to be effective. However, a review of <a href="http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10973/06GollwitzerSheeran_ImplementationIntentionsAndGoalAchievement.pdf?sequence=1">nearly  100 scientific studies</a> found they &ldquo;make an important difference to whether  or not people achieve their goals&rdquo;. They help with <a href="http://findings.org.uk/docs/Armitage_CJ_2_findings.pdf">drinking less</a> too. </p>
          <p>So why not go to Progress &gt; Create and view action plans, and set up some plans  for  times when you think you'll drink more than you want.          </p>
