            <p>Achieving a goal   is easier when you&rsquo;ve got a plan.  Planning helps you manage situations when you may be tempted to drink a bit too much.</p>
            <p>For example, how might you plan to avoid having that drink that takes you over the edge? How might you plan to deal with drinking excessively at parties? How might you plan for drinking nothing at all for a few days each week?</p>
