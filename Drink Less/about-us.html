            <h1>About Us</h1>


            <p>If you use this app to help you drink less alcohol you're in good hands. The app has been developed by a highly qualified team of experts based at University College London, with support from leading researchers from other universities. Professor Susan Michie and Professor Robert West both have extensive experience in helping people achieve behaviour change goals. Dr Jamie Brown led a successful project called StopAdvisor to help smokers quit and runs ongoing studies about alcohol use. Dr David Crane has developed a very popular app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-quit-smoking-now/id577767592?mt=8">Smoke Free</a> and Dr Claire Garnett is a researcher specialising in behaviour change apps. We've developed this app to study whether it helps people drink less alcohol so we can learn how to do this better. We will publish our findings so that others can benefit. So by using the app you're not only helping yourself but are helping science too. Thank you.
