            <p>Tap the drink type or amount to display options for that item.</p>
            <p>To edit ABV (that's the alcoholic strength of your drink) you'll need to tap on the figure itself. It's bit clunky, we know. But we've found it the easiest way to let you set the ABV precisely.</p>
            <p>Price per drink works in a similar way, tap the figure to enter or edit.</p>
            <p>It probably won't surprise you to learn you can adjust the quantity by tapping the + or - button.</p>
            <p>To save time next time you can add this as a regular. Regulars are stored in the Regulars tab underneath all the icons of drinks.</p>
