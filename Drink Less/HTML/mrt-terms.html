            <h1>Information sheet for a research project</h1>

            <p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decided to take part, it is
            important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will
            involve. The information here will try and answer any questions you might have about the
            study, but contact us at <a href="mailto:support@drinklessalcohol.com">support@drinklessalcohol.com</a> if there is anything else you’d like to
            know. Please read the following carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.</p>
            
            <p><em>Who is conducting the research?</em><br/>
            We are a team of researchers at University College London and London School of Hygiene
            and Tropical Medicine.</p>
            
            <p><em>Why are we doing this research?</em><br/>
            We want Drink Less to be an app that you want to use. There are features in the app which
            may or may not encourage you to carry on using the app. We want to know how to improve
            these features. We are only interested in how you use the app during the first 30 days.</p>
            
            <p><em>Why have I been chosen?</em><br/>
            You are eligible to take part in this study if you are aged 18 years old or older, have indicated
            that you are interested in using the app to drink less alcohol, and have a score of 8 or more
            on alcohol use disorders identification test, as we are particularly keen to support this group
            in continuing to use the app. Most importantly, it is your decision to take part or not.</p>
            
            <p><em>What will happen if I choose to take part?</em><br/>
            If you choose to take part in this study, the reminders that Drink Less sends you may have
            different wording compared with people who choose not to take part. Otherwise, your
            experience with the app will not be different to other people.</p>
            
            <p><em>Could there be problems for me if I take part?</em><br/>
            We do not anticipate any problems caused by taking part in this study.</p>
            
            <p><em>What data will you collect about me?</em><br/>
            We will not at any time access any personal information about you, such as your name,
            address, email address. We will collect data about your age, gender, occupation type, and
            your alcohol consumption when you download the app. For the following 30 days we will
            collect data about how you use the app, such as did you use the app or how long you spent
            on the app. It is not possible for us to identify you in this study, and the app will not provide us
            with any other information available on your phone.</p>
 
            <p><em>What will happen to my data at the end of the research?</em><br/>
            At the end of the study we will make a dataset available to the public here: <a href="https://osf.io/q8mua">https://osf.io/q8mua</a>.
            It will not be possible for anyone to identify you in the dataset. The dataset will only contain
            your general characteristics (age, gender, occupation type, baseline alcohol consumption) and
            how you used the app for 30 days, such as did you use the app or how long you spent on the
            app. The content of the diaries will not be made available to us or anyone else.</p>
            
            <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask Professor Susan Michie on <a href="mailto:support@drinklessalcohol.com">support@drinklessalcohol.com</a></p>
