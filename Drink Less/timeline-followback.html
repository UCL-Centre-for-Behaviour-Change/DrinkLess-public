            <p>A couple of techniques can help you  remember the drinks you had a few days ago. Use your diary to remind yourself  of where you were and what you were doing on certain days; that often triggers  memories of any drinks you had. Or if you&rsquo;ve got regular drinking patterns these  can help you recall your drinking. For example, you may go out for drinks after  work each Thursday, meet friends on Fridays, or have wine with a meal on  Saturdays (and Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays!).Â  </p>
            <p>Try to be as accurate as you can, the  better you can recall your drinking the more we can help you reduce it. The  best way of all is to set the daily reminder to on (it&rsquo;s in the Help section)  and complete your drinking diary at a regular time each day.</p>
