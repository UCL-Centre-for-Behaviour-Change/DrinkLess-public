            <p>Each morning we'll ask four questions about your mood,  productivity, clarity and sleep quality. The idea is to help you gain a deeper  picture of the effects of alcohol, which we do by comparing your scores on heavy  drinking days against light/no-drinking days. You can see the results on Progress &gt; Your  hangover and you. </p>
            <p>It's a good idea to answer these questions at the same time  each day. Doing so will make comparisons between  scores more accurate.</p>
            <p>Any comments you make can be found on the Calendar entry for  that day.</p>
            <p>Answers to the &quot;Did you drink more than you wanted to  yesterday?&quot; question can be found on Progress &gt; What has and hasn't  worked.</p>
            <p>Don't be surprised when the Add Drinks screen pop ups after  you've answered Yes to &quot;Any alcoholic drinks to record?&quot; It's our way of making  your life a little easier.</p>
