            <p>The data we use for the comparison comes from a large survey called the Alcohol Toolkit Study <a href="http://www.alcoholinengland.info/">http://www.alcoholinengland.info</a> that has asked over 90,000 adults in England about their drinking.</p>
            
            <p>The survey includes people who only drink occasionally or not at all, who are easy to forget about as we usually socialise with people who drink similar amounts. It is actually very common for people to under-estimate how much they drink compared with others.</p>
            
            <p>Don&rsquo;t worry if this came as a bit of a surprise. There are plenty of things you can do to cut down, and we&rsquo;ve created Drink Less to help you do just that.</p>
