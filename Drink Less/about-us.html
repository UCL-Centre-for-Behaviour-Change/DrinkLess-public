            <p>Drink Less has been developed by a highly qualified team of experts based at University College London, with support from leading researchers at other universities. <strong>Dr Claire Garnett</strong> is a researcher specialising in digital behaviour change interventions. <strong>Professor Jamie Brown</strong> leads a programme of research on digital interventions for alcohol reduction and smoking cessation. <strong>Professor Susan Michie</strong> is an internationally renowned expert in behaviour change. <strong>Professor Robert West</strong> is a world leader in addiction research. <strong>Dr David Crane</strong> has developed a very popular app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-quit-smoking-now/id577767592?mt=8">Smoke Free</a></p>
            <p>We've developed this app to study whether it helps people drink less alcohol so we can learn how to do this better. We will publish our findings so that others can benefit. So by using the app you're not only helping yourself but are helping science too. Thank you!/<p>
